        answer:
          "RealU is a mobile app for exploring and transforming your inner nature, mind, and awareness through ancient practices of meditation and conscious breathing (pranayama), passed down and refined over thousands of years.",

          "Our priority is to share original, time-tested knowledge straight from authentic sources, without distortion or unrealistic promises. We don't overwhelm you with endless content. Instead, we focus on what truly matters: essential, grounded, and practical guidance. Real practice starts with real understanding. It's this kind of depth that helps you make clear decisions, stay centered, and face life's challenges—not by avoiding them, but by becoming aware, processing them consciously, and moving through them with clarity.",

        text: "Where should I start after downloading the app?",

      {
        text: "I'm a beginner. Should I start with meditation or breathwork?",
        answer:
          "Start with whatever feels right to you—these practices are deeply connected. Watching the breath is already a form of meditation. The more natural, soft, and extended your breathing becomes, the easier and more engaging it is to observe in meditation. If your goal is to enter a meditative state more quickly, focus on the psychic pranayama techniques like Bhramari, Ujjayi, or Bhujangini.",
      },
      {
        text: "I'm new to pranayama. Where should I begin?",
        answer:
          "Start with the Basic Breathing Patterns Course. It helps you assess how efficient your natural breathing is and adjust any habits. From there, move on to the Basic Pranayama Course, where you'll gradually explore different yogic breathing techniques, along with essential knowledge—such as benefits, contraindications, and correct execution. Building this foundation supports a more effective and steady practice.",
      },
      {
        text: "Can I practice breathing if I have a cough or a blocked nose?",
        answer:
          "The nasal passage plays a vital role in proper breathing. If you're experiencing nasal congestion or a cold, the swelling and excess mucus can restrict airflow. In these cases, it's best to pause breathwork practices until you've recovered. A chronic cough isn't necessarily a contraindication, but any acute respiratory infection is. Intense breathing can push infection deeper into the lungs and worsen the condition—so wait until you're fully recovered.",
      },
      {
        text: "What are the benefits of extending the inhale and exhale?",
        answer:
          'Extending the inhale helps fill the lungs with oxygen and vital energy (prana), improves lung capacity, supports heart function, and increases oxygen in the blood. Extending the exhale helps eliminate carbon dioxide and metabolic waste. The longer and smoother the exhale, the more thorough the cleansing process—and the more space you create for fresh air on the next inhale. As yogic wisdom says: "The longer the breath, the longer the life."',
      },
      {
        text: "Should I always try to use full yogic breath?",
        answer:
          "Full yogic breath is a great training tool: it connects abdominal, thoracic, and clavicular breathing into one smooth wave. But in daily life, it's enough to use abdominal and chest breathing. Full yogic breath is mostly used in specific categories like cleansing, cooling, and psychic breathing practices.",
      },
      {
        text: "Can pranayama help with recovery after illness?",
        answer:
          "Yes, especially using psychic breathing techniques like Ujjayi.",
      },
      {
        text: "What's the right order—pranayama first or meditation first?",
        answer:
          "Pranayama prepares both body and mind for deeper concentration and stillness. So ideally, practice pranayama first, followed by meditation. You can also do them separately at different times of day, if needed.",
      },
      {
        text: "Why can't I hold my breath for very long?",
        answer:
          "There could be various reasons—physical or psychosomatic. Your breath retention may decrease if you're tired, anxious, have eaten recently, worked out, or are recovering from stress or overexertion.",
      },
      {
        text: "Why do I experience the same technique differently on different days?",
        answer:
          "That's natural. Your mental and physical states are constantly shifting. Sleep, emotions, weather, time of day, solar activity, etc. — all these subtle factors affect how the body and mind respond to the same practice.",
      },
      {
        text: "How do I know I'm progressing?",
        answer:
          "By how naturally and easily the practice flows, and by the gradual, effortless extension of your inhale, exhale, and breath retention over time.",
      },
      {
        text: "How can I keep practicing during stress or apathy?",
        answer:
          "Through consistency, pranayama becomes as automatic and natural as brushing your teeth. No matter your emotional state, if your body knows Ujjayi or Kapalabhati and is used to practicing daily, it will return to them instinctively—just like putting on your coat or fastening a seatbelt.",

    title: "Meditation",
    questions: [
      {
        text: "What is meditation and how does it affect us?",
        answer:
          "Meditation works like this: we all have sensory organs (which perceive and desire), organs of action (which act on those desires), and the mind (which generates the impulses of the desires). Every desire, whether fulfilled or not, creates inner duality: joy and sorrow. Only when this cycle of desire quiets down can we find steadiness and neutrality. That comes from pausing the thought stream and redirecting the mind away from craving toward concentration. This state of inner steadiness becomes a powerful, nourishing resource—one that lets us act with greater clarity and calm, rather than reacting from impulse.",
      },
      {
        text: "How do I know which meditation is right for me right now? For example, when it comes to meditations on different energy centers, should I choose the first chakra, the second, and so on? Or maybe a completely different technique would be more helpful right now?",
        answer:
          'If we take this example, each energy center (chakra) relates to physical organs, emotions, and specific needs or desires. Choose a meditation that supports your current mental or physical state—one that helps cultivate the qualities you\'re seeking right now. You can also take the in-app test "Your meditation here and now" to get personalized suggestions based on your present condition.',
      },
      {
        text: "I didn't feel any changes during or after meditation. Why?",
        answer:
          "Consistency is key. Try repeating the same meditation at least three times before evaluating its impact. It may take a few sessions for the practice to begin revealing its effects.",
      },
      {
        text: "Why learn how to meditate at all?",
        answer:
          "The goal of RealU is to help you understand the core principles of meditation—not as a random mix of ideas or visuals, but as a structured path. It's a journey from deepening concentration to the cessation of chaotic mental interpretations. Meditation teaches you how to guide your mind, organize your thoughts, and redirect your sensory perceptions. It's easiest to learn under guided instruction, since the mind loves to wander. But once you learn how to focus and enter the meditative state, you can practice independently.",
      },
      {
        text: "What if I feel bored while meditating?",
        answer:
          'Try different techniques until you find one that resonates with you personally. Choosing the right meditation can be easier with the app\'s "Find Your Meditation Technique" test. It will suggest several options that best suit you for regular practice—based on your preferences, experience, and other factors.',
      },
      {
        text: "How can I understand if I'm doing the meditation techniques correctly?",
        answer:
          "If you're able to hold a thread of concentration for even a few seconds, you're on the right path.",
      },
      {
        text: "I find it hard to believe in something I can't feel, like energy movement. What would you say to skeptics?",
        answer:
          "Try this: move your body—dance, work out, run. Then stop suddenly, sit down, close your eyes, and observe. You'll feel your body vibrating. That's your energy in motion. But during such activities, it tends to move in an uncontrolled flow and quickly dissipates from the body. Calm, steady concentration makes it possible to direct the energy and amplify its potential.",
      },
      {
        text: "What's the difference between Buddhist and yogic meditation?",
        answer:
          "Buddhism is deeply rooted in the Indian yogic tradition. There are three main branches: Theravāda, Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. Theravāda meditations (like śamatha and vipassanā) focus on minimizing thoughts and observing the mind or a meditation object—similar to yogic practices like śūnya and sākṣibhāva from the jñāna yoga path. Mahāyāna schools often emphasize breath-based practices like Zen meditation, which resemble the breathwork in svara yoga or prāṇa vidyā. Vajrayāna meditations, like tummo (working with fire energy) or deity fusion, are closely aligned with haṭha and tantra yoga. In essence, Buddhist and yogic meditations are like twin siblings but with their own paths.",
      },
      {
        text: "I've tried meditating a few times but always quit. What do you recommend?",
        answer:
          "Don't push yourself to meditate for long periods. Keep it simple: even 10 minutes a day is enough. If you miss a day, don't be hard on yourself. Just return when you're ready. That rhythm is part of the practice too.",
      },
      {
        text: "Can meditation help with psychological issues like low self-esteem or relationship difficulties?",
        answer:
          "Meditation helps you reconnect with yourself. Many of us live trying to meet external expectations. But real strength comes from being true to yourself—and meditation guides you back to that.",
      },
      {
        text: "I'm not religious. Is this approach still for me?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Meditation is not tied to any religion. Its roots are in ancient yogic tradition, which developed across many regions of India that practiced Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, Sikhism, and more. The essence lies in the technique itself, which is not limited by any religion.",
      },
      {
        text: "Can meditation make me happier?",
        answer:
          "It helps you see clearly what happiness means for you. And once you know that, your own choices and actions will guide the way.",

    title: "Yoga Nidra",
    questions: [
      {
        text: "How is yoga nidra different from meditation?",
        answer:
          "Yoga nidra is a guided practice that brings you into a state of consciousness between waking and sleep. It's often more accessible than meditation techniques because it's done lying down. Additionally, unlike many meditation techniques, yoga nidra directs attention to the physical body, making its practices easier to engage with and sustain mental focus. This practice teaches the mind to observe the body, emotions, and energy with full attention. It also helps to release physical and mental tension and creates a space for deep relaxation.",
      },
      {
        text: "What are the benefits of yoga nidra?",
        answer:
          "Yoga nidra relaxes the body, eases muscular tension, balances blood pressure, improves sleep, supports memory, and helps restore the nervous system.",
      },
      {
        text: "What's better during the day—a nap or yoga nidra?",
        answer:
          "Yoga nidra is the better choice. It relaxes both body and mind without making you feel sluggish or mentally dull.",
      },
      {
        text: "How and why does intention work in yoga nidra?",
        answer:
          "During a session of yoga nidra, your subconscious becomes more open and receptive—your thinking mind quiets down, and your deeper awareness wakes up. In this state, setting an intention is a powerful way to plant a seed of positive change. The intention gently enters the subconscious mind and becomes a guiding influence, like committing to a morning routine or making a healthy change. It's important that the intention relates to you personally.",
      },
      {
        text: "I often fall asleep during yoga nidra. Is that a problem?",
        answer:
          "Not at all. Fatigue naturally builds up in the body and mind, and lying down often signals the nervous system to rest. Therefore, it's natural for our body and mind to slip into sleep once they reach a certain level of relaxation. This commonly happens during yoga nidra practice as well. With each yoga nidra practice, you'll find it easier to stay focused for longer while following the guide's voice.",
      },
      {
        text: "Is yoga nidra suitable for beginners?",
        answer:
          "Yoga nidra is suitable for practitioners of all levels. For beginners, it serves as a foundational step toward transitioning into seated meditation.",
      },
      {
        text: "How long does a Yoga Nidra session last?",
        answer:
          "Anywhere from 20 minutes to 90 minutes, depending on the format and your available time.",
